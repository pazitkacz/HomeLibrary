# HomeLibrary
My own private "library" for learning purpose. First php application that I show to the world.
Just a simple database and application for home use. Created to make list of existing books and board games in my home and in the same time learning how to create simple web application in php.
PHP used is 8.1, no framework, created in PhpStorm in trial version.


To use, first open the SQL file in order to create database and tables - they are filled with few datas already, can be deleted or changed.
Then start on localhost, main php file is index.php
